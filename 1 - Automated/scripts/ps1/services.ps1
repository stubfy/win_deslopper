# services.ps1 - Align service startup types to the reference main PC
#
# Strategy: Most services are set to Manual (demand-start via SCM trigger or
# explicit Start-Service call). Windows will start them automatically when
# needed by a component that depends on them -- the difference is they no longer
# auto-start during boot, reducing baseline CPU/disk activity at session start.
#
# Startup type mapping (registry Start value):
#   2 = Automatic              (starts at boot, no delay)
#   2 + DelayedAutoStart=1    = AutomaticDelayedStart (starts ~2 min after boot)
#   3 = Manual                 (starts on demand / trigger)
#   4 = Disabled               (cannot start unless manually re-enabled)
#
# Two writes per service (Set-Service + direct registry DWORD) ensure the change
# is visible to both the SCM API and the raw registry simultaneously, avoiding
# cases where one layer disagrees with the other after a failed Set-Service call.
#
# DoSvc (Delivery Optimization): Set to Disabled AND its TriggerInfo sub-key is
# removed. TriggerInfo causes SCM to automatically start DoSvc when certain
# network events fire (e.g., ETW network connectivity trigger). Removing it
# prevents SCM from relaunching DoSvc behind our back after Start=4 is applied.
# This is intentional redundancy on top of DODownloadMode=0 in privacy.ps1.
#
# Rollback: restore\services.ps1 reads backup\services_state.json and
# restores each service to its pre-tweak startup type.
